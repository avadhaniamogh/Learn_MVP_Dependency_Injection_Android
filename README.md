# Learn_MVP_Dependency_Injection_Android

A simple Android application which demonstrates the Model View Presentor (MVP) design pattern and also Dependency Injection using Dagger 2.

I wrote this Android app to learn about dependency injection using Dagger 2 library.
I followed the following tutorial to comprehend dependency injection: https://www.raywenderlich.com/146804/dependency-injection-dagger-2
A quick shout out to the awesome guys who created the wonderful tutorial. I endorse the tutorial for anyone who wants to learn about dependency injection in android.

The app adopts the MVP design pattern. The app also utilizes butterknife libraries for view injection.
