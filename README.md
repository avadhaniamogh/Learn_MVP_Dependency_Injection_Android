# Learn_MVP_Dependency_Injection_Android - Food App

A simple Android application which demonstrates the Model View Presentor (MVP) design pattern and also Dependency Injection using Dagger 2.

The app makes REST calls to Usda server to find out food information. 

I wrote this Android app to learn about dependency injection using Dagger 2 library.
I followed the following tutorial to comprehend dependency injection: https://www.raywenderlich.com/146804/dependency-injection-dagger-2

A quick shout out to the awesome guys who created the wonderful tutorial. I endorse the tutorial for anyone who wants to begin learning about dependency injection in android.

The app adopts the MVP design pattern, utilizes butterknife libraries for view injection and employs retrofit for REST network calls.
